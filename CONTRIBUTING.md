# How to Contribute

For this project to get better it is essential that the open source community helps implement the best practices, helps find bugs and issues, and contributes tot he project in any shape or form. I wanted to implement some simple contribution guidelines so that. Just remember the goal of this project is to organize the users file system in the best way possible and how they would like to do it. Currently we are not at that goal, but with the help from the open source community I think it is definitely possible.

# Some Contribution Rules

- First: You must submit an issue or comment that you will work on an existing issue.
    - You must clearly describe the issue and how you reproduced the issue if it is a bug
    - If it is a enhancement or feature request then you must describe why we must add this to the project in detail.
- Second: If approved to do so, you may fork the repository.(This doesn't mean you can't fork your own project from this one)
    - Contribute to your own branch relevant to the topic you are working on
        - `git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`
        - `git checkout -b enhancement/master/my_contribution master`
    - You must place detailed comments in your code of why you did certain things
    - Avoid working on the `master`
- Third: You must read the coding standards guidelines (`once it has been created, until then just try to keep it at least a lil consistent with coding style`)
- Forth: Once you have completed it make a Pull Request, this will go under very strict review since the project handles users personal files. Any security, dangers, or other important concerns will be addressed in the review. User security is a top priority in this project, we must not let this be used for malicious reasons.
- Fifth: If your Pull Request is accepted, it will be added to the code base.
