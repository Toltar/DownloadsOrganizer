# DownloadsOrganizer
Ever get tired of you downloads folder getting messy? Well a simple script can do the trick. This will organize your folders by file-type.


Currently to run the script you just run this command:

    `python downloadsOrganizer.py`

It only runs on Windows systems but I will get OSX and Linux support in the future
