# DownloadsOrganizer
Ever get tired of you downloads folder getting messy? Well a simple script can do the trick. This will organize your folders by file-type.


Currently to run the script you just run this command:

    `python downloadsOrganizer.py`


It only runs on Windows systems but I will get OSX and Linux support in the future
# TODO
- [ ] Enable Background Service Support for Windows
- [ ] Enable Background Service Support for Mac
- [ ] Enable Background Service Support for Linux
- [X] Have the script make folders and put the associated files within those folders
- [ ] Find better and faster ways to implement this



Any PRs are welcome
